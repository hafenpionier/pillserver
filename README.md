# Welcome to PillServer

The Idea of PillServer was inspired by a friend, who had a person he cared for that too often forgot which pill to take. Since usual Pill-Dispensers are only as good as they are used, we thought about a pill serving tool, that cares for your pills and the times you need to take them. A sorted stock of pills get ejected just in time and a chatbot makes a friendly reminder for the pills. Since there are often caring members I also added a feature that makes caring people do their jobs more easily: When the pills are not withdrawn they can get informed via the chatbot, so they can get into action and check if there are any troubles.
